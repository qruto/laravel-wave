# Introduction

Unlock the power of
Laravel's [broadcasting system](https://laravel.com/docs/master/broadcasting)
with **Wave**. Imagine that real-time server broadcasting is possible over
native HTTP without any ~WebSockets~ setup.
Meet the
**[Server-sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events)** üõú
Works seamlessly with Laravel's default `redis` broadcasting driver and
supports [Laravel Echo](https://github.com/laravel/echo).

Experience it live with our [demo streaming tweets](https://wave.qruto.dev) üê§.

> Server-Sent Events (**SSE**) is specially tuned for real-time server-to-client
> communication.

_Compatible
with_ [<img width="150" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laravel/echo/master/art/logo.svg" />](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/broadcasting)
[<img width="150" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laravel/octane/2.x/art/logo.svg" />](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/octane)
[<img src="https://herd.laravel.com/images/appicon.png" width="40" />](https://herd.laravel.com)

## üåü Key Features

**‚ö° Works with native Redis Driver**: Wave seamlessly integrates with Laravel's
default `redis` broadcasting driver, ensuring efficient real-time data transfer.

**üîÑ Resume From Last**: Connection drops? No problem! Wave intelligently resumes
the event stream from the last event, ensuring no crucial data is lost in
transit.

**üü¢ Live Models**: With a simple interface that respects Laravel's native
conventions
for [Model Events Broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/master/broadcasting#model-broadcasting)
and [Broadcast Notifications](https://laravel.com/docs/master/notifications#broadcast-notifications),
Wave turbocharges your application with real-time updates.e

**üçÉ Resource-Friendly Broadcasting with `pauseInactive`**: This feature
maximizes resource efficiency by closing the data stream when user inactive (
such as when the user minimizes the browser) and automatically reopens it upon
resumption of visibility. Turned off by default.

**üéõÔ∏èÔ∏è Full Requests Control**: Wave hands you the reins over connection and
authentication requests, granting you the freedom to shape your broadcasting
setup to your exact requirements.

## Installation

### Laravel 11 or higher

Install the package via Composer at first, then install broadcasting setup:

```bash
composer require qruto/laravel-wave
php artisan install:broadcasting
```

### Laravel 10 or lower

Install **Wave** on both server and client sides using Composer and npm:

```bash
composer require qruto/laravel-wave
npm install laravel-wave
```

Then, set your `.env` file to use the `redis` broadcasting driver:

```ini
BROADCAST_DRIVER = redis
```

## Usage

After installing **Wave**, your server is ready to broadcast events.
You can use it with **Echo** as usual or try `Wave` model API to work with
predefined Eloquent events.

In Laravel 11 or higher, after `install:broadcasting`, you will find:

- broadcasting channel authorization file in `routes/channels.php`
- broadcasting configuration file in `config/broadcasting.php`
- echo instance in `resources/echo.js`
- _(optional)_ **Wave** configuration file in `config/wave.php`

### Manual usage

Import Laravel Echo with `WaveConnector` and pass it to the broadcaster option:

```javascript
import Echo from 'laravel-echo';

import { WaveConnector } from 'laravel-wave';

window.Echo = new Echo({broadcaster: WaveConnector});
```

<details>
    <summary>
        For Laravel 10 or lower, locate Echo connection configuration in
        <em>resources/js/bootstrap.js</em> file.
    </summary>

```diff
- import Echo from 'laravel-echo';

- import Pusher from 'pusher-js';
- window.Pusher = Pusher;

- window.Echo = new Echo({
-     broadcaster: 'pusher',
-     key: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_APP_KEY,
-     wsHost: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_HOST ?? `ws-${import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER}.pusher.com`,
-     wsPort: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_PORT ?? 80,
-     wssPort: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_PORT ?? 443,
-     forceTLS: (import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_SCHEME ?? 'https') === 'https',
-     enabledTransports: ['ws', 'wss'],
- });
+ import Echo from 'laravel-echo';

+ import { WaveConnector } from 'laravel-wave';

+ window.Echo = new Echo({ broadcaster: WaveConnector });
```

</details>

Use Echo as you typically would.

documentation.

### Use Live Eloquent Models

With native conventions
of [Model Events Broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/master/broadcasting#model-broadcasting)
and [Broadcast Notifications](https://laravel.com/docs/master/notifications#broadcast-notifications)
you can use
**Wave** models to receive model events and notifications.

```javascript
import { Wave } from 'laravel-wave';

window.Wave = new Wave();

wave.model('User', '1')
    .notification('team.invite', (notification) => {
        console.log(notification);
    })
    .updated((user) => console.log('user updated', user))
    .deleted((user) => console.log('user deleted', user))
    .trashed((user) => console.log('user trashed', user))
    .restored((user) => console.log('user restored', user))
    .updated('Team', (team) => console.log('team updated', team));
```

Start by calling the `model` method on the `Wave` instance with the model name
and key.

By default, Wave prefixes model names with `App.Models` namespace. You can
customize this with the `namespace` option:

```javascript
window.Wave = new Wave({namespace: 'App.Path.Models'});
```

## Persistent Connection with Nginx + PHP FPM

Wave is designed to automatically reconnect after a request timeout.
During reconnection, you won't lose any events because Wave stores event history
for one minute by default
and resumes it. You can adjust the duration of event history storage by
modifying the `resume_lifetime` value
in the config file.

However, if you want to maintain a persistent connection, let's configure your
web server.

### `fastcgi_read_timeout`

By default, the `fastcgi_read_timeout` value is `60s` for Nginx + PHP FastCGI
server setup.

#### Option 1. Without changing the `fastcgi_read_timeout` value

> Ensure that the interval between events pushed into Wave connection is shorter
> than the read timeout value

To enhance the certainty of events occurring more frequently than the standard
timeout,
Wave attempts to send a ping event with each Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection
request,
provided that the previous event occurred prior to the `ping.frequency`
configuration value.

If your application doesn't expect many real-time connections,
specify the list of environments in which a ping event will be sent
with each Wave connection. By default, this is set to `local`.

#### Option 2. Manual ping control

To ensure accurate frequency sending a ping event:

1. Disable automatic sending by changing the `ping.enable` config value
   to `false`
2. Use the `sse:ping` command to manually send a single ping or operate at an
   interval

Run the command with the `--interval` option to send a ping event at a specified
interval in seconds,
for example let's send a ping event every `30s`:

```bash
php artisan sse:ping --interval=30
```

So, every `30s`, the command will send a ping event to all active connections
and
ensure that the connection remains persistent, because the frequency of sending
events is less than `60s`.

Alternatively, use the
Laravel [Tasks scheduler](https://laravel.com/docs/master/scheduling#introduction)
to send a ping event every minute or more often
if `fastcgi_read_timeout` value is greater than `60s`:

```php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule->command('sse:ping')->everyMinute();
}
```

### `request_terminate_timeout`

Some platforms, such as [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com), configure
the PHP FPM pool with `request_terminate_timeout = 60`, terminating all requests
after `60s`.

You can disable this in the `/etc/php/8.1/fpm/pool.d/www.conf` config file:

```ini
request_terminate_timeout = 0
```

or you can configure a separate pool for the SSE connection.

## Support

In light of recent events in Ukraine, my life has taken an unexpected turn.
Since February 24th, I've lost my commercial work, my permanent residence,
and my ability to plan for the future.

During these challenging times, I derive strength and purpose from creating
open source projects, such as Wave.
